I am currently working as PhD researcher at [IBOIS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ibois/research/) (Laboratory for TImber Construction) et [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland. My topic of research is around Augmented Reality, Computer Vision and Machine Learning for timber construction, for more info click [here](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ibois/augmented-carpentry/). If you want to collaborate or you have a nice project to propose just send an email to [andrea.settimi@epfl.ch](andrea.settimi@epfl.ch)!
