### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Andrea!

I am currently working as PhD researcher at IBOIS (Laboratory for TImber Construction) et EPFL, Switzerland. My topic of research is around Augmented Reality, Computer Vision and Machine Learning for timber construction, for more info click [here](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ibois/augmented-carpentry/). If you want to collaborate or have a nice project to propose just send an email to [andrea.settimi@epfl.ch](andrea.settimi@epfl.ch)!
